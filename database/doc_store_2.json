Because toddlers can't always say what they want or need, and because words describing feelings are more complicated and develop later, a frustrating experience may cause a tantrum. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease.\nToddlers want independence and control over their environment \u2014 more than they can actually handle. This can lead to power struggles as a child thinks \"I can do it myself\" or \"I want it, give it to me.\" When kids discover that they can't do it and can't have everything they want, they may have a tantrum.\nHow Can We Avoid Tantrums?\nTry to prevent tantrums from happening in the first place, whenever possible.
